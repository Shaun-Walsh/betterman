## Usage
This is a standard website for promotional purposes. A grid layout is deployed to structure the site into the following sections:

- **Header**
- **Sidebar** | **Main Content**
- **Footer**

Navigation is handled in the sidebar, which is implemented using the 11ty navigation plugin. The website makes use of Nunjucks partials/templating and features semantic HTML elements. Flexbox is implemented on the gallery page for responsive design.

The code is pushed to GitHub and automatically built and deployed on Netlify.
